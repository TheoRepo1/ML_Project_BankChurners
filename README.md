# ML_Project_BankChurners

The aim of this project is to create a Machine Learning model to predict customer attrition in a bank. This notebook is structured in three main steps:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**

We'll start by displaying the overall characteristics of our portfolio of bank customers by performing descriptive statistics and graphical visualisations. This step will give us an overview of the data and enable us to draw some useful initial conclusions.

- **Data pre-processing:**

Next, we'll proceed to data pre-processing. This will include cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for model training. We will also display some intermediate results to help with the selection of relevant models and variables.

- **Model optimisation and prediction:**

Finally, we will proceed to optimize the model by adjusting its hyperparameters to maximize its performance. This stage will involve the evaluation of several cross-validation and model selection techniques. The aim is to develop a robust and accurate model to predict which customers are most likely to leave the bank.

Technically, we'll be looking to maximise the F1-score metric, thereby striking an optimal balance between precision and recall. This will help us minimise both false positives and false negatives, ensuring that our model correctly identifies customers likely to leave the bank, while reducing misclassification errors.
